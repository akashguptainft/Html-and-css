    <p> <a id="anchor1"></a> India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[26] is a country in South Asia. 
        It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous 
        democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, 
        and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China,
         Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India
          is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime 
          border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.

        Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.
        Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made
         the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled life
          emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving
          In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on
           India's southern and western coasts.[43] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran 
           India's northern plains,[44] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India
            into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara
             Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46] In the Punjab, 
             Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[47] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, 
             ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.
             [h][49] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India
              into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule
               began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological 
               changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root.[53]
                A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent
                 resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British
                  Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority
                   Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life
                    and an unprecedented migration</p>
